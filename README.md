# Auto-Tracking-Camera-for-Demonstrators
# 1st year Hardware Project


This is an Arduino based project.

Our project provides demonstrators and presenters the ability to conduct presentation hassle free. Our camera poses the ability to move according to the demonstrator without any human interference

Demonstrators and presenters are unable to operate the camera single-handedly while presenting. As a solution for this many of the presenters must hire a cameraman to project what is done in real time, which amounts to an extra cost but a necessity. Also, during this pandemic time as, virtual events have become the new norm the need for a camera has become vital.
